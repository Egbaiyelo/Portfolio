        "content": "English Abstract In the frost-bitten wilderness of the Canadian Rockies, climatologist Dr. Elena Vance discovers a rhythmic seismic pulse originating from deep within a supposedly dormant glacier. As she decodes the signal, she realizes it isn’t a natural phenomenon, but a countdown. When her research station is sabotaged and her team goes missing, Elena must flee across the tundra to protect her data. With a shadowy private military firm on her heels and a catastrophic geological event looming, she discovers that the 'meridian' is actually a bridge to a forgotten history—one that humanity was never meant to wake.",
